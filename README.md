# ðŸ¦‹ Versioning and Publishing with Changesets

This repo uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to manage versioning across packages.  
Publishing is automated via GitHub Actions and happens directly when changes are pushed to `main`.

## ðŸ”§ When should you add a changeset?

Add a changeset **whenever you make a change that should result in a new version** of a package:

- âœ… New feature â†’ `minor`
- âœ… Bug fix â†’ `patch`
- âœ… Breaking change â†’ `major`

---

## âœ… Workflow Summary

### 1. Make your code changes

Modify your package as needed (`api-types`, `agent-sdk`, etc.).

### 2. Add a changeset file

Run:

```bash
yarn changeset
